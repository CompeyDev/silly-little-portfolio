    Recently, I set forth attempting to learn lower level languages, mainly [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). After hours of confused stack overflow searches and debugging — I gave up; the borrowing system was just too confusing for me (for now...).
    However, all was not lost; while browsing through some source code on GitHub, I was inspired to rather learn [Go](https://go.dev). With this newly found love for Go, I set forth creating my first major Go project: [Quickie](https://github.com/datalinkhq/quickie). Quickie is a REST API built using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com), a web framework similar to many others (express, django, etc.) but for Go. Quickie is a redis caching layer for my startup, [datalink](https://datalink.dev). 

    <br />
    After briefly going through the Gin docs, I got started, building a general framework & playing around with it. Eventually, I began the redis implementation using [redis-go](https://github.com/redis-go/redis), with two main endpoints, set & get (pretty self explanatory). While working with JSON data to store in the database, I learnt working with serialization & deserialization along the lines of:
    <br />
    <div style="background-color: #1f1f1f">
    ```go
    import (
        "encoding/json"
        "fmt"
        "github.com/go-redis/redis"
    )

    type dataValue struct {
        Table string `json:"table"`
        Value any    `json:"value"`
    }

    func main() {
    client := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
            Addr:     "localhost:6379",
            Password: "",
            DB:       0,
    })
    var dataValues []*dataValue
    dataValues = append(dataValues, &dataValue{Table: table, Value: value})

    s, _ := json.Marshal(dataValues)
    
    // Now we can finally store it in the database
    _, err := client.Set(key, s, 0).Result()  
    }
    ```
    </div>
    <br />
    I also learnt about pointers **AND THEY ARE INSANELY COOL**. Moving on, I realized rate-limiting was vital and therefore set it up too, with a [handy little library](https://github.com/JGLTechnologies/gin-rate-limit). Overall, the developer experience with Go was amazing, the best way I could describe it would be:
    <br />
    > "the lovechild of typescript & rust"

    <br />

    Anyway, it's out so you can check it out [here](https://github.com/datalinkhq/quickie) if you'd like! Feel free to share feedback, as I'm still learning :)
